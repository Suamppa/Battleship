Battleship project by Samppa Alatalo, 2207843
For the course User Interface Programming at the University of Turku.

This unfinished project is the start of a Battleship game. Currently it only features setup stages, which I focused on getting done first due to the nature of the course. I picked Unity for the project because it is what I'm currently most familiar with when it comes to the frontend.

Goals:
- Implement a simple Battleship game in Unity
- Utilize free assets
- Learn to implement UI logic and flow
- Learn UI development in Unity

Most notable missing pieces:
- Gameplay, sadly
- Can't quit the game
- Number of ships is not implemented yet
- Quantity counter is not implemented yet

Pitfalls:
- Unfamiliarity with Unity's UI systems
	- I've done basic things, this involved a lot of UI interaction
- First time utilizing grids in Unity
	- This cost a lot of time in the end
- Many aspects that seemed simple on the surface turned out to be rabbit holes, sometimes because of Unity

What was learned:
- A ton about the ins and outs of UI in Unity
- A lot more familiarity with Unity's event system
- Adapting UI to different screen sizes
	- The game board and the ship selection screen may be prone to errors in this regard in the returned state
- State management through game options and UI flow

AI tools:
The most notable tool utilized in this project was GitHub Copilot. While considerably more clumsy with Unity projects than most other kinds, it still provided a lot of convenience and guidance on a lot of topics. Nothing was solved solely through it, its main use came in the form of autocompletion to save time, but it was also very helpful for asking questions about my specific circumstances because it is able to gather the context from the workspace (except for things related to Unity's inspector).
